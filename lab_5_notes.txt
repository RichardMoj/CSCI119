string will be finite

Q = states
	states will always be listed by integers
	Q = [0,1,2] <-- example

ts: Int -> Char -> Int
ts 0 'b' -> 0
ts 1 'a' -> 1


4 helper functions?

1. norm?

2. elem

3. and [ elem ]

4. recursive or list comprehension
	[ | q<- qs, sigma]
	and ^
	make sure every result is an elem of qs



head and tail
ts 1 'b'. empty

delta* =  base 2 cases


m@(qs, s, fs,ts) means m = to the whole thing () but can still reference
		individual pieces such as qs


acceptCons will be recursive





part 2

DRAW THE FSM first




exactly
	can make list of variable length [0..()]
