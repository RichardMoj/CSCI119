can't use norm $ in our definitions for cart or powerset
no nub, sort, etc

Assume user knows how to do correct stuff?

check first element in ordered pair, if equal check other element in pair

powerset - an element by element comparison

x:xs == head:tail

use "let" or "where" in the definition

chapter 6 haskell learning book

LOL checking numbers first then element by element 
(LOL 3 "aaa") < (LOL 3 "bbb")

redefining ++ and reverse type for LOL
can use them in the definiton

extract the list from LOL and pattern matching/stuff


can't use norm in any of part 3


for duplicates in merge, remove both, take 1


merge can be used in concat definiton for languages
	
concat
	dot x y  -> concat the head for both lists
		dot x ys -> concat the head for list 1 and the rest of the list of l2
			dot xs (y:ys) -> concat the rest of l1 with everything from l2



case stripPrefix p s of
	nothing ->
	Just x ->
